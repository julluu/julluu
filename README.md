### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juulia, second year Information Science Student at University of Oulu. I'm also an emergency radiographer.

When it comes to programming, I've mainly programmed in  Java, but I've also learned the basics of Elixir, C and Python. I have used Mac and Windows. I mainly use VSCode as a platform.
Of the courses I attended, I would name Data Structures and  Algorithms, Databases, Programming courses and Information
Security as the most important.
